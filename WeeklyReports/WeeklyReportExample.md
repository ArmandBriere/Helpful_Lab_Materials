## Phage Purification for Phage Therapy

I did some more phage hunting with Pat's animal fecal samples. Long story short, it was a bust and I did not get any phages again. From here I am taking two routes forward.

1. I tried emailing a few people to see whether I can get ahold of some purified phages to start getting some preliminary data with mice. As of now it looks like I will be able to get some E coli phages to use, which will be great.

2. I will be getting **sewage** from the **wastewater treatment plant** so that I can start isolating phages from it. I will start growing this both on E coli, as well as other bacterial hosts that are part of this list:

* E. coli

* Bacteroides fragilis

* Bifidobacterium (genus)

* Lachnospiraceae (family)

* Barnesiella (genus)

* Akkermansia (genus)

## *C diff* Virome Dynamics in mice

I started the ~3 week long mouse experiment in which I am taking a stool sample every 12 hours for 5 days before and after C diff infection. Not a whole lot to report for now, other than that it is underway and I pray I do not have a problem with C diff infection contamination when the time comes.

## Phage-Bacteria Interaction Prediction

My script for predicting phage - bacteria associations using my protein network database is coming along nicely in my "down time". Right now I tried running it on my laptop because it is easier and I have the needed permissions, but I need to move it over to FLUX. Unfortunately I am having problems with the permissions so that is still a work in progress.

## Summary
At this point it has been six months in the lab, which is terrifying because it means the year is half over and I need to make at least one paper happen before the end of the year. I think that these projects are the most likely to yield publications in both the short and long term.
